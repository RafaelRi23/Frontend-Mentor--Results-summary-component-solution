## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Doing this challenge helped me to acquire more knowledge about flexbox. I got stuck in some parts, but in the end everything worked.

### Continued development

In my future projects I want to learn more about media queries and CSS in general, I am struggling a bit with these.
